Dr. Mark Smale of Landcare Research has [written an excellent report](/assets/documents/LongbushEcosanctuaryFloraAndVegetationByLandform.pdf) on the botany of Longbush Ecosanctuary by landform, including the surrounding Protected Management Areas. He suggests an ecological zone in the area around the Ecosanctuary in the lower Waimata valley. What a great idea!
