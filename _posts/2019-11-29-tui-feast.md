A wonderful flowering of plants this year has resulted in crowds of birds taking advantage of Nature’s generosity.  Tūī, Korimako and Tauhou have been raiding first the Kōwhai, then Ngutukākā and now the Harakeke, with only a minimum of aggro.  We are surrounded by Pipiwharauroa, and Kōtare are perched everywhere.
