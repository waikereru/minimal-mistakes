The amazing Ecoworks team have created a world first by establishing and successfully rearing the first inland colony of Titi (grey Petrels). These were translocated to burrows in the Petrel station erected by the team on the Longbush hills and 3 birds successfully fledged and took off for foreign parts. We look forward to seeing them back in about three years. The colony recreates what was once a naturally occurring habitat for these seabirds, and is the first ever to be established away from a coastal site.
