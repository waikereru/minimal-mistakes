Christmas at Longbush this year was special, with long, hot blue days and bursts of rain - the plantings seemed to grow before our eyes! Ten titi chicks fledged, stretched their wings, and flew off across the Pacific. Kereru sat around in pairs, looking contented. The robins are thriving, and we hope to see babies in the bush before long. Many thanks to the Williams Trusts and the Eastern and Central Community Trust for their support of the robin project - they're endearing little birds.

Plans are afoot to introduce kiwi and weka to Longbush - watch this space.
