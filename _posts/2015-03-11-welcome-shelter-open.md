The Longbush Welcome Shelter has been formally opened by Meng Foon, the Mayor of Gisborne, and is [creating a big buzz in architectural circles](http://architecturenow.co.nz/articles/longbush-ecosanctuary-welcome-shelter/) and in the local community. Look out for our proposals for a Wild Lab at Longbush - with a Discovery Trail for kids, and the Welcome Shelter as its hub.
