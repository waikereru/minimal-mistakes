Matt Evans and his team at the Eastland Institute of Technology are building this bridge in Longbush Reserve, funded by the Williams Trusts and the Eastern and Central Community Trust, and designed by Jeremy Salmond. This will give people a longer walk in the riverside bush, which is in great shape after more than 10 years of intensive pest and weed control. Thanks to all concerned for their generosity, skill and hard work.
