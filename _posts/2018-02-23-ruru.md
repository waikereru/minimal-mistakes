Steve and Tim Salmond were standing on the Waitui bridge at midday when this ruru flew under the bridge and perched on a nearby tree. We think it's a young ruru that our neighbours found on the roadside with an infected eye. They took it home, treated it and fed it, then released it in Longbush. This may be why the bird was flying during the day, and is unafraid of people.
