Another flock of 10 titi took off from Longbush on their journey across the Pacific this Christmas. They are attracted by bright lights, but luckily, decided to ignore the Rhythm and Vines festival. Patsy Matthews did a brilliant job of looking after the chicks, and we're hoping that they will return to Longbush in three years' time, to establish an inland colony.
