Its great to be working with local researchers Sheridan Gundry, Murray Palmer and Mike Marden, and University of Auckland scientists Dan Hikuroa, Carola Cullum and Gary Brierley on the life history of the Waimatā river.

We've learned a lot, with many community members adding their knowledge and insights to the story. We want to work with the wider community to find ways of taking care of the river, to ensure that it stays in good heart for future generations.
