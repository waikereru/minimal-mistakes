Sarosh Mulla and his fabulous team of volunteers have spent the summer break erecting the [Welcome Shelter at Longbush](/shelter) - a ground-breaking exercise in collaborative place-making. Heartfelt thanks to the sponsors, especially Karen and Graeme from the Chartwell Trust, who turned up on site to support the project; and the volunteers, especially Sarosh and Kathy, Tony and Rachel, Theo, Finn, Patrick and Mel, Dan, Johnno and everyone else who has made this such an exceptional project.

[Listen to Sarosh talking about the Welcome Shelter](/assets/mp3/architect_of_an_innovative_eco_classroom.mp3) and how he dreamed up this project on National Radio.
