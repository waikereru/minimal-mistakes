Fantastic to see Sarosh Mulla's [Claude Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_glass) installed at Waikereru, reflecting Motukeo.  (A scaled up version of a convex obsidian mirror named after the 18C landscape artist Claude Lorraine). Artists used these to reflect and shrink a landscape, painting it from the reflection, facing away from the scene.
