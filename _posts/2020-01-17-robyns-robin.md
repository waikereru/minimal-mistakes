Robyn Wilkie spotted a toutouwai (N. Island robin) from our relocation programme some years back towards the north end of Longbush Reserve; and Malcolm Rutherford tracked it down and took this gorgeous photo.  

Now we're just waiting for the 'oi (grey faced petrels) to come home from their Pacific OE.  Apparently this can take up to 8-10 years!
