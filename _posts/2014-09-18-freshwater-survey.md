Many thanks to Murray Palmer for [an excellent report on the freshwater ecosystems at Longbush](/assets/documents/FinalFreshwaterReportLongbush.pdf), which we aim to make a haven in the region for freshwater species including koura (freshwater crayfish), kakahi (freshwater mussels), giant kokopu and Hochstetter frogs. The streams are in great shape, after only 4 years of regeneration, while the ponds need a more reliable water supply and some work on phosphorus levels. Never a dull moment, so many great projects to do!
