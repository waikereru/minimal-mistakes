Recent flooding of the Waimata River caused the banks to collapse, and the river turned to liquid mud. As a result, our Chairperson Dame Anne wrote a plea to take care of the rivers in the Turanga district. This was [published in the Gisborne Herald](http://longbushreserve.org/documents/TakeCareOfOurRiversLast.pdf) and attracted widespread support.
