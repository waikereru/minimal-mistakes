The [Waimatā Catchment Restoration Project](https://www.facebook.com/Waimata-Catchment-Restoration-Project-112407203838612/) is up and running, with funding from the Erosion Control Fund, Lois Easton (former Head of Science at Gisborne District Council) as Project Administrator, and Laura Savage (formerly member of the GDC Freshwater Team) as Project Manager. Farmers representing 70% of the catchment are already on board - awesome.  Watch this space!
