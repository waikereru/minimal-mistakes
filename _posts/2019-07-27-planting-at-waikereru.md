Such a pleasure to have artist Raewyn Atkinson come to Waikereru with 20 kowhai ngutu kākā mā​ (white kaka beak) after her successful exhibition 'I Too am in Paradise' at Objectspace in Auckland.  

These special plants were gifted by East Coast iwi, Ngāi Kohatu (Ngāti Hinehika), who are kaitiaki for this particular species that had long been considered extinct. It was a joy to plant them out with Raewyn, Jan Bieringa​ and Sheridan Gundry.
