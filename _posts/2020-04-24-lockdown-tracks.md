Jeremy and Anne have been making tracks in lockdown.  First effort - a 800 metre track up the Waikereru Stream.  Absolutely beautiful, with clouds of pÄ«waiwaka overhead, and kereru, bellbirds, tui and the odd curious tomtit.

Also a stray German tourist, who appeared unexpectedly on the track in jandals and lycra cycle gear.  They had to ask him (nicely) to leave - 'Auf wiedersehn!'
