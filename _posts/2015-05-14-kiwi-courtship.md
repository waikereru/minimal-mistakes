Anne and Jeremy's kiwi namesakes, Ani and Jem, have been found together in their burrow at Whinray Reserve, Motu. According to Steve Sawyer, "Jem is an extremely handsome male kiwi weighing in at a fighting weight of 2.25 kg, in excellent condition. Very exciting. He is now wearing a radio transmitter and we will be able to follow their breeding progress starting in July and move their chicks into the kiwi creche at Motu". Jeremy says that Jem has a better crop of feathers than his namesake. Nice to know that we may be starting another family soon! Can't wait to have our own kiwis at Longbush.
