The trustees have decided to change the name of the Ecosanctuary to its original name, **Waikereru**. The Kereru is our guardian bird, which features on our seal, so that stays the same.

The riverside bush will still be called Longbush - the name its long been known by in the district - including when we were kids. Since the Ecosanctuary is a haven for native plants, birds and other animals, this name change seems appropriate. We'll always honour the full history of the site, though, and the Longbush name for the riverside bush.
