Homage to Brighde Penn from Waimatā, and Ruby from Wales for these spectacular costumes of a kereru and mayfly (and a mayfly puppet) for the Wild Lab / Tiaki Taiao (now called 'TT' for short) workshops.  

Brighde is studying theatre in Wales and makes costumes for Doctor Who, ​so there's more global talent adding lustre to this awesome wilderness education programme.
