Last weekend a host of landscape architects arrived at Longbush, and spent the morning exploring the Ecosanctuary. The Longbush team - Sarosh Mulla, Megan Wraight, Steve Sawyer and Janine Te Reo - gave fantastic presentations on what is happening on site.

It was a pleasure to have such thoughtful, expert and interesting visitors, and many thanks for their advice on how to fix an incontinent pond and their generous koha to the Longbush Trust.
