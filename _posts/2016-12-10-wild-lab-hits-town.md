The Wild Lab had another workshop at Longbush on Saturday, this time featuring the koura (native crayfish). Pete and Elle Jarratt with Murray Palmer, freshwater ecologist, headed into Gisborne city for a coffee, wearing the Oi and Koura costumes. The kids had a fabulous session at Longbush, exploring the koura's powers. We're grateful to the Lion Foundation for backing the Wild Lab.
