**The Wild Lab Tiaki Taiao** aims to inspire young people in Te Tairāwhiti (East Coast) in a creative, science-based quest to understand what has happened to local ecosystems since human arrival, and to take part in restoring these to a state of ora (health, well-being).

Here, leading experts in scientific disciplines interact with experts in Māori ancestral knowledge, in workshops for young people designed and delivered by inspiring teachers.

Mātauranga, Science, Arts and Technology are taken into the wilderness, resulting in real world, immersive learning that is vivid and unforgettable.
