The 1769 Garden commemorates a turning point in the history of Aotearoa New Zealand, when the Endeavour commanded by James Cook arrived at the mouth of the Waimata River in October 1769.  It features plants that grew in the Tairawhiti, and were familiar to local MƒÅori at that time.

Many of the species collected by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander from the Royal Society party of scientists and artists on board the Endeavour are now rare or endangered.  The Garden offers a way of exploring the lives of plants and animals in the Tairawhiti before 1769; and how these have changed through time.

Malcolm Rutherford, trained at the Oxford Botanic Gardens, and Graeme Atkins, tohunga taiao from Ngati Porou, are kai tiaki (guardians) for the garden and its interpretation.

The Welcome Shelter above the garden was designed by Sarosh Mulla as his PhD project and featured in an exhibition at the Venice Biennale. Built by volunteers with aroha and materials and funding donated by sponsors, the Welcome Shelter serves as a base for our wilderness education programme for children, Wild Lab / Tiaki Taiao.

In the Wild Lab / Tiaki Taiao, delivered by Pete and Elle Jarratt and co-designed with Longbush Trustees, scientists and matauranga experts, stories are told about local landscapes and their plant and animal inhabitants. Rare and endangered species are celebrated through ancestral knowledge, science, art and immersive experience, and a sense of wonder and fun.
