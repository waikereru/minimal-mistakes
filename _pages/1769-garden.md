The **1769 Garden** commemorates a turning point in the history of Aotearoa New Zealand, when the *Endeavour* commanded by James Cook arrived at the mouth of the Waimata River in October 1769.  It features plants that grew in the Tairawhiti, and were familiar to local Māori at that time.

Many of the species collected by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander from the Royal Society party of scientists and artists on board the *Endeavour* are now rare or endangered.  The Garden offers a way of exploring the lives of plants and animals in the Tairawhiti before 1769; and how these have changed through time.

Malcolm Rutherford, trained at the Oxford Botanic Gardens, and Graeme Atkins, tohunga taiao from Ngati Porou, are kai tiaki (guardians) for the garden and its interpretation.

The [**Welcome Shelter**](/shelter) above the garden was designed by Sarosh Mulla as his PhD project and featured in an exhibition at the Venice Biennale. Built by volunteers with aroha and materials and funding donated by sponsors, the Welcome Shelter serves as a base for our wilderness education programme for children, Wild Lab / Tiaki Taiao.

In the [**Wild Lab / Tiaki Taiao**](/wildlab), delivered by Pete and Elle Jarratt and co-designed with Longbush Trustees, scientists and matauranga experts, stories are told about local landscapes and their plant and animal inhabitants. Rare and endangered species are celebrated through ancestral knowledge, science, art and immersive experience, and a sense of wonder and fun.

## Design of the garden

### Philip Smith, O2 Landscapes, Designer
The 1769 Garden was designed by Philip Smith to evoke the experiences of Banks and Solander during their visit to Tairawhiti, taking inspiration from their collections and the observations they made at the time. 

Planting the garden began in  2 June 2015, and continues to evolve, guided by Philip, Malcolm and Graeme..

### A blaze of yellow
From the car park you are greeted by a grove of Kowhai (Sophora tetraptera).  When Banks and Solander first arrived in Turanganui-a-Kiwa (Gisborne) on October 8 1769, the kowhai trees were in flower.

### Native as exotic
Local flora and fauna, familiar to Māori, seemed very exotic to Banks and Solander.  This was the first time that plants from Aotearoa had been seen, collected and studied by Europeans.

As you cross the bridge with its poutama pattern (based on tukutuku woven panels in meeting-houses) and enter the 1769 Garden, the plants seem unfamiliar or exotic - with bright pops of the green foliage and white flowers of Scandia rosifolia (NZ angelica), strange forms of Coprosma rhamnoides, and as you walk up the paths, a land of tall shadowy columns created by the threatened plant Pittosporum obcordatum. 

### Intersecting groves
The lower garden is designed as a pattern of intersecting groves, first Kowhai, then Pittosporum obcordatum. On the upland path, this runs into a kahikatea grove, intersecting the existing kanuka forest. 

The Kahikatea trees in the forest grove are planted to appear as individual trees in the distance from the entrance (for at least the first 50 years or so). Banks mentioned “fine groves” of large trees on the flats at Turanganui, almost certainly kahikatea.

### Stone rows and mounds
The stone rows and mounds are designed to evoke the fine geometry of Māori gardens.

The stone rows are inspired by those found at Palliser Bay, where stone walls dictated the edges of gardens. 


The stone mounds are set out in a quincunx pattern (like the five on a dice), noted by Joseph Banks in the kumara gardens in Anaura Bay. In the 1769 Garden they’ve been laid out using pegged strings to create the precise geometry - the same method recorded by Banks.  

In the 1769 garden the stone rows and mounds are used to showcase rare and interesting plants, for instance Coprosma acerosa, Plantago raoulii, Pelargonium inodorum, Geranium retrorsum. 

## Banks and Solander 

**Joseph Banks** was a wealthy young landowner from Lincolnshire who had developed a passion for botany, and sponsored the Royal Society party of scientists and artists on board the *Endeavour*.  He was only 26 years old when the *Endeavour* arrived in Turanga-nui-a-Kiwa / Gisborne in October 1769. 

Banks was accompanied by **Dr. Daniel Solander**, a favourite student of the great Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus who invented binomial taxonomy, a method used to classify and organise the rich variety of new plants and animals that were being observed and collected by European explorers at this time.

The *Endeavour*, commanded by Lieutenant James Cook, had been sent by the Royal Society of London and the Admiralty into the Pacific to observe the Transit of Venus in Tahiti, and to discover Terra Australis Incognita, the fabled Unknown Southern continent that 18C geographers thought must exist to counterbalance the Northern continents.

When they came ashore in Turanganui, Joseph Banks was sure they had found Terra Australis, and in great excitement he and Dr Solander began collecting specimens of new and unfamiliar plants which they took back to the *Endeavour*’s Great Cabin  

There they were sketched by **Sydney Parkinson**, the Quaker artist; classified and described by Banks and Solander using the Linnaean method of (counting the pistels and stamens on their flowers); and pressed between pages of a commentary on Milton’s Paradise Lost.  Many of these pressed plants still survive in herbaria collections in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.

Banks and Solander collected 73 new species of plants in Turanganui-a-Kiwa; 115 in Anaura Bay; and 193 in Uawa (Tolaga Bay).
