Welcome to the **Waikereru Ecosanctuary** - an Ark in the Bush. The Ecosanctuary is a haven for rare and endangered species of native birds, plants and animals. It is reached by a winding gravel road up an inland valley, just 9 kilometres from Gisborne city on the Tai Rawhiti / East Coast of New Zealand.

From high hill ridges to the west, three streams tumble down steep valleys and across a plain, entering the Waimata River to the east. A rare surviving strip of lowland bush (Longbush Reserve) runs beside the Waimata River. The bush is alive with the sound of birds, including tui, bellbirds, fantails, kingfishers, whiteheads and many kereru or native pigeons. 

Waikereru Ecosanctuary is a fine example of ecological restoration in the Tai Rawhiti district, whose biodiversity is at extreme risk from land clearance, erosion and introduced plants and animals.  Here's a chant for Waikereru, composed by Merimeri Penfold:

> **Na Papa-tuanuku te karanga**
>  
> Nau mai, haere mai ki Waikereru  
> Mirimiria nga tikanga ki runga i au  
> Ki a Tane-mahuta  
> Ki a Tangaroa  
> Ki a Tawhiri-matea  
> Ki a Haumia-tiketike!
>  
> Kakahutia, manakitia,  
> Mo ake tonu e.  

> **This is the call of Papa-tuanuku (the Earth Mother)**
> 
> Welcome, welcome to Waikereru  
> Cherish my ancestral lore  
> Take care of Tane (the ancestor of trees, birds and flax),  
> Tangaroa (the ancestor of rivers, sea and fish),  
> Tawhiri-matea (the wind ancestor), and  
> Haumia-tiketike (the ancestor of wild food)!  
>  
> Clothe me, care for me  
> For ever.

## Nau mai, haere mai!

Visitors are very welcome at Longbush Reserve (to the right up Riverside Road), which is open to the public. Please stay on the track, be careful around electric fences, traps and streams, and take care of our precious bush.

Waikereru Ecosanctuary (including the Welcome Shelter and 1769 Garden) can be [visited by arrangement](mailto:longbush.reserve@gmail.com). We treat it like a marae – visitors very welcome, but the trustees need to know you’re coming!  The Waikereru Hills are actively managed, with trapping and shooting.  For health and safety reasons, access by arrangement only.
